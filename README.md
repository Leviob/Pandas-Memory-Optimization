# Pandas-Memory-Optimization
Exploring a lending dataset and optimizing for memory constraints by modifying datatypes and processing in chunks. 

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Understanding datatypes, their memory requirements and limitations
- How Pandas can be used to process datasets larger than available memory

## Dataset
The dataset comes from [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/), a marketplace for personal investors.

## Results
Simply by optimizing datatypes, the overall size of the dataset was nearly reduced to half of it's original size.
